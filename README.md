This is the maintenance tool for the online Catalog of Teratogenic Agents.

## Deployment

This uses Google App Engine, Google Cloud Storage for a database.

## Database

The 'database' is a single text file with LaTeX markup.  Originally this package (its ancestors, anyway) 
produced a real book.  That was before the internet.  

The LaTeX markup continues, but presently only the online editor is supported.
